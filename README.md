Intel 8085 Simulator
--------------------

8085 is a 8-bit microprocessor. The simulator will *try* to incorporate all the 
commands. The commands could be fed through:
- a file
- user at runtime (via the terminal)

Initially, I would like to make the simulator understand and react to the hex 
codes. But I'll also *try* to make an assembly parser for it.

If the parser is made, the commands can be fed either in hex or in assembly. It 
can also be used to implement interconversion between the two code types.
